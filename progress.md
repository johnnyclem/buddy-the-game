Original prompt: make a black and white derpy corgi who is the main character going to save another corgi that brown and white, and he goes through the common worlds seen in platformers

- Created `index.html` and `game.js` from scratch for a side-scrolling 16-bit noir platformer.
- Implemented core controls (WASD/Arrow support), jump (SPACE/ArrowUp), double jump, E head-butt special, poop-on-idle.
- Added auto-run pipe/trail segments in early worlds.
- Added fake noir/fantasy visual direction, rescue corgi pickup, and final evil cat boss.
- Added `window.render_game_to_text` and `window.advanceTime` for automation.
- Added `#start-btn` so Playwright can start from menu.
- TODOs after first run: tune collision boundaries, check victory transitions, confirm boss behavior and idle-poop trigger frequency.

- Added robust floor collider by injecting a world floor platform during world load to prevent instant fall deaths.
- Updated `state.player` reset Y to sit on-platform (`FLOOR_Y - PLAYER_H`).
- Added rescue pickup tolerance check via nearby-distance trigger so rescue can be captured in momentum-rich runs.
- Verified with Playwright runs and `state-*.json` that render pipeline reports:
  - mode/world transitions,
  - rescue + score increments,
  - auto movement and enemy/boss interactions,
  - and terminal `gameover`/`win` states when triggered.
- Known follow-up:
  - The environment’s Playwright client tool in this session lacked direct image-preview support, so visuals were validated via generated screenshot files + state JSON.
  - `WEB_GAME_ACTIONS` now includes `e` input mapping; head-butt automation can be exercised with custom payloads.
  - `type` in `/Users/johnnyclem/.codex/skills/develop-web-game/package.json` was set to `module` to run the bundled test client in this environment.

- Additional patch pass completed:
  - Reconnected gameplay tuning hooks after prior revert:
    - `HEAD_BUTT_COOLDOWN` and `HEAD_BUTT_IMPULSE` now drive head-butt timing/force.
    - Enemy stomps use `ENEMY_STOMP_BOUNCE`/`STOMP_SCORE` and proper enemy damage sources.
    - Boss contact/head-butt logic uses `BOSS_*` constants and score/iframes through `BOSS_HEADBUTT_DAMAGE`, `BOSS_HIT_SCORE`, `HEADBUTT_BOSS_INVULN`, `BOSS_ATTACK_INTERVAL`, `BOSS_BULLET_DAMAGE`, `BOSS_CONTACT_DAMAGE`.
    - Added `updateSoundtrack(dt)` in gameplay loop and `clearPressed()` once per frame so `keyPressed` is one-shot again.
    - Added soundtrack HUD overlay and included `soundtrack` payload in `renderGameToText`.
    - Boss HP bar now scales off `boss.maxHp`.
- Updated play-test validation: ran Playwright with custom action script including `e` (head-butt) and auto-run traversal actions.
- Validation output observed in `output/web-game/state-0.json` through `state-2.json` (menu->world transitions/rescue + combat states), with no `errors-*.json` generated.
- Next suggested pass: add a short boss-fight-focused action script to confirm stomps/head-butt can reduce `boss.hp` and drive win state deterministically.

- 2026-02-18: added temporary graphics pass and temporary procedural audio:
  - Added lightweight noir/SNES visual layer to `drawBackground`, stronger platform tile shading, and more character silhouettes.
  - Upgraded Buddy and Evil Cat renderers to look like more distinctive 16-bit sprites (ears/eyes/facial details, cat horns/eyes, boss glow).
  - Added an in-code Web Audio engine with music loop and SFX:
    - jump/double-jump
    - head-butt
    - stomp / breakable smash
    - enemy and boss hits
    - cat shots, rescue, hurt, and victory stabs
    - temporary looping boss/world-themed music tracks
  - Added small audio hooks and state exposure in `render_game_to_text` (`audio` block) for automation visibility.
  - Wired audio startup on game start and cleaned up music on win/game-over transitions.
  - Added a few debug-safe guards + warnings so missing AudioContext never blocks gameplay.
  - `node --check game.js` passes.

- 2026-02-18: verified and published.
  - Ran Playwright verification loop with local server at `http://127.0.0.1:5173`.
  - Screenshot and state capture artifacts generated at `output/test-deploy/shot-*.png` and `output/test-deploy/state-*.json`.
  - No `errors-*.json` logs reported by the client.
  - Render state confirms audio running: `audio.musicEnabled = true`, `audio.hasAudio = true`.
  - Published preview to Vercel: `https://buddy-the-game-hy6z2aw8s-johnnyclems-projects.vercel.app`.
  - Existing production deployment still present and unchanged: `https://buddy-the-game-dpqnznx7h-johnnyclems-projects.vercel.app`.

- 2026-02-18 (Pipe & Vapor edge repro/repair):
  - Confirmed user-reported stuck behavior in Pipe & Vapor was due one-sided auto-run math in `updateWorldCollisionAndMovement`.
  - In deployed `Pipe & Vapor District` state, `ArrowLeft` still pushed Buddy right when `autoRun` was active.
  - Patch applied in `game.js`:
    - `state.autoRun` now applies asymmetric input:
      - no input -> `desiredVx = RUN_SPEED`
      - hold left -> `desiredVx = -WALK_SPEED`
      - hold right -> `desiredVx = RUN_SPEED + 40`
  - Production re-deployed to `https://buddy-the-game.vercel.app`.
  - Playwright probe confirms left-input now moves backward in Pipe & Vapor:
    - `L { frame:0, x:598.7, vx:-80, autoRun:true }` then accelerates to `vx:-300` at frame 16
    - `gate { frame:20, x:2268.7, vx:-299.9, autoRun:true }`
  - No JS errors logged in this repro loop.
